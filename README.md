# Mushroom-edibility-prediction-
Description:
The Mushroom Edibility Prediction project aims to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its various attributes. This predictive model can be used to assist mushroom hunters or consumers in identifying safe mushrooms for consumption. The dataset used for this project contains information on various mushroom features such as cap shape, cap color, odor, etc., and their corresponding edibility labels.

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the edibility of mushrooms based on their characteristics. By leveraging this model, users can quickly determine whether a mushroom is safe to eat or not, thus reducing the risk of consuming poisonous mushrooms.

Features:

Python programming language
Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest)
Data preprocessing techniques
Model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the Mushroom Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of 61069 instances of mushrooms, each characterized by 21 attributes, including the target attribute indicating whether the mushroom is edible or poisonous.
